# Database Migration Summary

## ✅ What Was Created

I've created a complete database migration solution for your SoraFeed application with **three different methods** to migrate your PostgreSQL database from one server to another.

---

## 📦 New Files Created

### 1. **Migration Scripts**

#### `scripts/export-database.js`
- Exports all PostgreSQL data to JSON files
- Uses streaming to handle large datasets (like your 394k+ creators)
- Creates: `database-export/` folder with JSON files

#### `scripts/import-database.js`
- Imports data from JSON files back into PostgreSQL
- Handles conflicts gracefully with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Imports tables in correct order to respect foreign keys

#### `scripts/pg-dump-migrate.sh`
- Uses PostgreSQL's native `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` (most reliable)
- Creates compressed SQL backups
- Interactive prompts to prevent accidental overwrites

### 2. **Documentation**

#### `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- Complete 2000+ word guide covering all three methods
- Step-by-step instructions for each method
- Troubleshooting section
- Security best practices
- Verification steps

#### `MIGRATION_QUICKSTART.md`
- Super quick 5-minute guide
- Just the essential commands
- Perfect for experienced users

#### `DATABASE_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- Overview of everything created
- Quick reference

## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Reference)

### Method 1: PostgreSQL Native (Recommended) ⭐

**On source server:**
```bash
npm run db:backup
# Creates: database-backups/sora_feed_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz
```

**Transfer file:**
```bash
scp database-backups/sora_feed_*.sql.gz user@new-server:/path/to/soraFeed/database-backups/
```

**On destination server:**
```bash
npm run db:restore database-backups/sora_feed_*.sql.gz
```

### Method 2: JSON Export/Import

**On source server:**
```bash
npm run db:export
# Creates: database-export/ folder
```

**Transfer folder:**
```bash
tar -czf database-export.tar.gz database-export/
scp database-export.tar.gz user@new-server:/path/to/soraFeed/
```

**On destination server:**
```bash
tar -xzf database-export.tar.gz
npm run db:import
```

### Method 3: Direct Connection

See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for full instructions on setting up server-to-server connections.

## 📋 New NPM Commands

Added to `package.json`:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run db:backup` | Export database using pg_dump (compressed SQL) |
| `npm run db:restore <file>` | Import database from SQL dump |
| `npm run db:export` | Export to JSON files (handles large datasets) |
| `npm run db:import` | Import from JSON files |
| `npm run db:list` | List available backups |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why Three Methods?

1. **pg_dump (Method 1)** - Best for complete migrations
   - ✅ Preserves all PostgreSQL features, indexes, constraints
   - ✅ Most reliable
   - ✅ Compressed output
   - ❌ Requires pg_dump/psql tools

2. **JSON Export (Method 2)** - Best for flexibility
   - ✅ Human-readable data
   - ✅ Selective table migration
   - ✅ Cross-database compatible
   - ✅ Handles large datasets with streaming
   - ❌ Slower than pg_dump
   - ❌ Doesn't preserve all PostgreSQL features

3. **Direct Connection (Method 3)** - Best for real-time sync
   - ✅ No intermediate files
   - ✅ Can be automated
   - ❌ Requires opening network access
   - ❌ Security considerations

### Special Features

- **Streaming Export:** The JSON export uses batched streaming (1000 rows at a time) to handle your large tables without running out of memory
- **Compressed Backups:** pg_dump creates `.sql.gz` files to save disk space
- **Progress Indicators:** Shows progress during export/import
- **Safe Imports:** Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate data
- **Metadata Tracking:** Includes export date, table counts, and version info

---

## 📊 Your Database Stats

Based on the export attempt, your database includes:
- **creators:** 394,282 rows
- **scanner_stats:** 1 row
- **sora_posts:** (large table)
- Plus other tables

The scripts are optimized to handle this data size efficiently.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Backups contain sensitive data** - Protect them!
   ```bash
   chmod 600 database-backups/*.sql.gz
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

2. **Use encryption for transfers:**
   ```bash
   gpg -c database-backups/sora_feed_*.sql.gz
   ```

3. **Don't open PostgreSQL to the internet** - Use SSH tunneling instead

4. **Delete backups** from insecure locations after migration

---

## ✅ Updated Files

- `package.json` - Added new npm scripts
- `README.md` - Added migration commands to documentation
- All scripts made executable (`chmod +x`)

---

## 🧪 Testing

The scripts were tested with:
- ✅ Help command works
- ✅ List command works  
- ✅ .env file parsing fixed (handles spaces in USER_AGENT)
- ✅ JSON export handles large tables with streaming
- ⏳ Full backup/restore (ready to use when you need it)

---

## 📖 Where to Go Next

1. **Quick migration?** → Read `MIGRATION_QUICKSTART.md`
2. **Detailed guide?** → Read `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
3. **Test it first?** → Try: `npm run db:backup` (safe, just creates a backup)

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

All three methods include:
- Progress indicators
- Error messages with explanations
- Verification steps
- Rollback instructions (in full guide)

If something goes wrong, check `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` → Troubleshooting section.

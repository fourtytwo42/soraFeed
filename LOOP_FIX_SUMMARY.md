# Playlist Loop Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Video Restarts at End ✅
**Problem**: Video briefly showed first second again before moving to next video

**Solution**: Added immediate `pollServer()` call after marking video as played
- Eliminated 0-1 second delay
- Smooth transitions between videos

### Issue 2: Block Progression Stuck ✅
**Problem**: Stand Up block stuck at 5/10 videos, wouldn't continue

**Root Cause**: `getNextTimelineVideo()` ignored the display's current timeline position

**Solution**: Updated query to only return videos at or after current position
```sql
-- Before: Could return "old" videos
WHERE display_id = ? AND status = 'queued'

-- After: Respects timeline position
WHERE display_id = ? AND status = 'queued' AND timeline_position >= ?
```

### Issue 3: Loop Not Starting at End ✅
**Problem**: Playlist reached position 48/48 but wouldn't loop back to start

**Root Cause**: `checkAndStartNewLoop()` checked for ANY queued videos, not videos at current position

**Solution**: Updated to check for queued videos at or after current position
```sql
-- Before: Any queued videos anywhere
WHERE display_id = ? AND status = 'queued'

-- After: Only queued videos we can actually play
WHERE display_id = ? AND status = 'queued' AND timeline_position >= ?
```

### Issue 4: Race Condition Causing Duplicates ✅
**Problem**: Loop start triggered 3 times simultaneously, creating 144 videos instead of 48

**Root Cause**: Multiple poll requests (every 1 second) detected end simultaneously and each started a loop

**Solution**: Added in-memory lock to prevent concurrent loop starts
```typescript
const loopStartInProgress = new Set<string>();

// Check if already starting
if (loopStartInProgress.has(displayId)) {
  return false; // Skip this request
}

// Set flag before starting
loopStartInProgress.add(displayId);

try {
  // ... start loop ...
} finally {
  // Always cleanup flag
  loopStartInProgress.delete(displayId);
}
```

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
1. **src/app/player/[code]/page.tsx**
   - Immediate poll after video end (line 261)

2. **src/lib/queue-manager.ts**
   - Added loop start lock (line 8-9)
   - Fixed `getNextTimelineVideo()` to respect position (line 253-287)
   - Fixed `checkAndStartNewLoop()` to check correct position (line 349-436)

### Maintenance Scripts Created
1. **scripts/debug-timeline.js**
   - Diagnose timeline state
   - Show block progress
   - Identify stuck videos

2. **scripts/fix-timeline-position.js**
   - Fix position mismatches
   - Mark skipped videos

3. **scripts/clean-duplicate-timeline.js**
   - Remove duplicate videos from race conditions
   - Renumber positions

4. **scripts/test-loop-start.js**
   - Test if loop will start correctly

## How It Works Now

### Normal Playback Flow
1. Video plays to completion
2. `onEnded` fires → `handleVideoEnd()` called
3. Mark video as played (increments timeline_position)
4. **Immediately** poll for next video (no delay!)
5. Server returns next video at new position
6. Video loads and plays seamlessly

### End of Playlist Flow
1. Last video ends (position 48/48)
2. Mark as played (position → 48)
3. Poll for next video
4. `getNextTimelineVideo()` finds no videos at position >= 48
5. `checkAndStartNewLoop()` called
   - Checks for lock (prevents duplicates)
   - Sets lock flag
   - Clears old timeline
   - Resets position to 0
   - Increments loop count
   - Populates 48 new videos
   - Releases lock
6. Next poll returns video at position 0
7. Playlist loops with fresh videos!

## Current Status

✅ All videos playing smoothly without restarts
✅ Blocks progressing correctly
✅ Playlist loops automatically at end
✅ No duplicate videos from race conditions
✅ Timeline respects position correctly

## Maintenance Commands

### Check Timeline Health
```bash
node scripts/debug-timeline.js ATER2F
```

### Fix Position Mismatch
```bash
node scripts/fix-timeline-position.js ATER2F
```

### Clean Up Duplicates
```bash
node scripts/clean-duplicate-timeline.js ATER2F
```

### Test Loop Logic
```bash
node scripts/test-loop-start.js ATER2F
```

## Technical Details

### Timeline Position Logic
- Each video has a `timeline_position` (0-based)
- Display tracks current `timeline_position`
- `getNextTimelineVideo` returns first queued video where `position >= display.position`
- When video ends, position increments by 1
- When no videos found at current position, loop starts

### Loop Start Conditions
1. No queued videos at or after current position
2. Display not already starting a loop (lock check)
3. Active playlist exists
4. At least one video found in database

### Race Condition Prevention
- In-memory Set tracks displays currently looping
- Check-and-set pattern with try/finally cleanup
- Prevents multiple simultaneous loop starts
- Handles errors gracefully

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes
- Videos restarted at end ❌
- Stand Up stuck at 5/10 ❌
- Playlist didn't loop ❌
- 144 duplicate videos created ❌

### After Fixes
- Smooth video transitions ✅
- All blocks complete fully ✅
- Automatic looping ✅
- No duplicates ✅
- Position tracking accurate ✅

## Notes

- The race condition was caused by 1-second polling interval
- Multiple requests could see the same "end state" simultaneously
- The lock prevents this without changing polling frequency
- Cleanup scripts provided for any edge cases

## Future Improvements

Consider:
1. Database-level locking for multi-server scenarios
2. Longer polling interval when no playback changes
3. WebSocket-only updates (eliminate polling)
4. Transaction wrapping for loop start operations
